# Sine-Wave-Inverter
Pure Sine Wave Inverter using PIC16F877A microcontroller

The project was done in the 4th year of my bachelor's. Me and a couple of friends attempted to design a Pure Sine Wave inverter capable of outputting close to 200 Watts of power. The circuit consisted mainly of a PIC16f877A Microcontroller that controls the Switching frequency of two MOSFET transistors along with other basic components on the board, such as a Full Bridge Rectifier that rectifies the output of the Inverter to enable us to measure its peak Voltage (Vmax). The output of the Rectifier is connected to the input of the microcontroller. The PCB board was designed in EAGLE.
